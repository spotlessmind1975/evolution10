**EVOLUTION 10** is an evolution based game for [COMMODORE 64](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) home computer. In this game the player assumes the role of "selective pressure" in the evolution of a species. Given a target objective, he/she will have to choose two specimens from those proposed so that they can reproduce themselves and so he/she approaches to the expected result. This game is designed for a single player and it is text-based.

This game was created to participate in the ["BASIC10Liner" competition 2021](https://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/rules2021). Since it joined this competition, the game itself is modest in size, the given source code respects strong constraints on the length of each line (category: **PUR-120**) and it does not rely on third party libraries.

For those wishing to deepen the details of its implementation please refer to the following documents:
